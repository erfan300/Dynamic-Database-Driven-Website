## About this project

This project consisted of creating a website which allows users to register/login to keep track of their personal projects. This was done through using the Laravel Framework meaning that the model-view-controller architecture is used on the server-side for the login/register functionalities which is linked with the MySQL users table and the project functionalities are linked with the MySQL projects table, the client-side technologies used were HTML and CSS.

The database used was designed to be in 3NF for maximum efficiency (managed in MySql)

There are 6 implemented security features such as: authentication, authorisation, form validation, hash passwords, cross-site request forgery, and handle injections.

Unfortunately there are a few files/folders that won't be able to be uploaded to Github, but they are standard files/folders found in any Laravel project such as the .env file connecting the website to the database.

The finished product: (http://220117609.cs2410-web01pvm.aston.ac.uk/portfolio_3/public/home).
